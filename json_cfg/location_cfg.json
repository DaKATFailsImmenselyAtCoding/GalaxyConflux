The flashing lights of all the ads for amazing products, the fancy-looking window displays, the sweet melodies that go from the speakers to your ears and the always moving people mass are turning your brain into the always-consuming machine is supposed to be, making you feel slightly dizzy. Down in the hallways you find your local gig where you can **~work** in. You will have to move with your elbows through the shopper stampede to arrive there, though."

Here all the students in the city amass books and knowledge to pass their exams and reach their dreams!

This is definitely a good place to **~study** in, if you focus and keep yourself quiet!"

This hipster-looking cafeteria was recently bought by a young long-bearded guy with prominent arm tattoos who's highest aspiration in life was to run his own coffee shop. The walls have some posters of old movies you haven't seen but you guess they're good, because if they weren't the man running this place wouldn't have put them there. On one side of the room, near the sofas, there are two small shelves: One containing old vinyl records that are the background music of the place, and another one containing 80s Japanese manga that the costumers can read while eating. They're mostly mahō shōjo series. Weirdly specific, you think."

But on the nighttime, the clubs and discos in the area open to their drunken regulars, lighting with neon dye the city's skyscrapers. Lately a rumour has arisen saying that here, at night, avoiding the young ravers and the old alcoholics, a fight between the forces of good and bad takes place, where monsters are fought by unknown yet powerful individuals. Of course, the city's authorities have qualified this rumour of 'just another urban legend'."
